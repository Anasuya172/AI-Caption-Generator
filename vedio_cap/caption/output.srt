00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
A spiritually enriching period is approaching Chaturmas, the holy union of the four holiest Hindu months,

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,680
Shravan, Bhadrapat, Ashwin and Karting.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,680
It begins on 6 July and continues until 2 November.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,600
Understanding the significance of this divine period is essential for every seeker.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,920
Let's understand in simple words how one can derive the maximum spiritual benefit from Chaturmas.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,440
Commencing on Devchani Ekadashi in the month of Ashad

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:35,720
and concluding on Devchani Ekadashi, Chaturmas offers a golden opportunity to gain spiritual wealth.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:41,840
During these four months Lord Narayana enters yogic sleep, that's Yognidra

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,720
and becomes deeply absorbed in his Brahminic state, hence chanting austerity, sacred bathing,

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:55,760
vows, fasting undertaken during this time, yield many fold results compared to other days.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Let us understand six or species acts to be performed during Chaturmas.

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,640
First, doing noble deeds that Satkarma.

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,080
Second, listening to divine discourses that Sat-San Bhagwatkatha.

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,920
Third, serving saints. Fourth, taking darshan of saints and attending Sat-San.

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,160
Fifth, worshipping the Lord with devotion. Sixth, engaging in charity.

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,360
Each of these acts is said to yield immeasurable spiritual rewards.

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,120
Now let us understand what should be practiced during Chaturmas.

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:36,920
Those who observe celibacy and sleep on the ground during these four months accumulate immeasurable merit

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,040
and attain exceptional spiritual progress.

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,560
One who eats only once a day throughout Chaturmas becomes free from disease, gains spiritual strength

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,720
and earns the merit of performing the sacred Agnistom Yajna leading to divine reams.

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,000
Observing vows and disciplines during this period grants one the merit of a thousand Ashwameda Yajnas.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,960
Reciting the Vishnu Sastranama or Purushasukthaam during this time brings both spiritual merit and powerful speech.

24
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,560
Drinking Panchagavya, that's a sacred Ayurvedic preparation made up mainly of Kaayurine.

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,920
During Chaturmas is considered highly purifying and beneficial for health.

26
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,600
Now let us understand what should be renounced during Chaturmas.

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,400
No wedding or auspicious worldly ceremonies should be performed during this period.

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,200
Renouncing curd helps maintain good health and leads to Goloka attainment,

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,200
that is, divine reams attainment. Renouncing salt brings in her purification and freedom from

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,520
sins. Giving up jaggery leads to the attainment of a sweet nature. Renouncing honey, coconut,

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,320
pomegranate, urad dal, chickpeas, enhances one's spiritual merit.

32
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,320
Avoid using copper and bronze utensils. Instead, it meals on palash leaves which brings the fruit

33
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,720
of observing chandraena and ikadashi fasts. Take a vow to refrain from marital intimacy and

34
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,760
completely refrain from engaging in gossip, both speaking and hearing it.

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,040
